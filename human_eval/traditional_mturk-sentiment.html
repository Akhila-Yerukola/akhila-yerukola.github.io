                        Thanks for participating in this new task!
                        We are trying to test out a few automatic systems for rewriting sentences to have a desired <span class="task_toxicity">toxicity (less offensive)</span><span class="task_sentiment">sentiment (positive or negative) level</span><span class="task_formality">formality (formal or informal)</span>. 
                        <br>
                        Given an utterance from a dialog or a document, an instruction for rewriting from <span class="task_toxicity">toxic/offensive to non-toxic/non-offensive </span> <span class="task_sentiment">positive to negative or vice versa </span> <span class="task_formality">formal to informal or vice versa </span> and two automatically generated rewrites, please answer the following four questions about the rewrites:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong><span class="task_toxicity">Toxicity</span><span class="task_sentiment">Sentiment</span><span class="task_formality">Formality</span></strong><br>Which of the rewrites best exhibits the <em>required <span class="task_toxicity">toxicity</span><span class="task_sentiment">sentiment</span><span class="task_formality">formality</span> </em> as in the instruction (regardless of meaning preservation)? </li>
                            <li><strong>Event level meaning </strong><br>Which do you think is <em>closer in meaning wrt event-level information to the original</em> utterance</span> (regardless of the <span class="task_toxicity">toxicity</span><span class="task_sentiment">sentiment</span><span class="task_formality">formality</span> change)?</li>
                            <span class="task_toxicity"><li><strong>Intended Meaning </strong><br>Which do you think is <em>closer in the intended meaning of the original</em> utterance</span> (regardless of the <span class="task_toxicity">toxicity</span><span class="task_sentiment">sentiment</span><span class="task_formality">formality</span> change)?</li></span>
                            <span class="task_formality"><li><strong>Intended Meaning </strong><br>Which do you think is <em>closer in the intended meaning of the original</em> utterance</span> (regardless of the <span class="task_toxicity">toxicity</span><span class="task_sentiment">sentiment</span><span class="task_formality">formality</span> change)?</li></span>
                            
                            <!--<li><strong>Fluency</strong><br>Which of the rewritten utterances is the <em>most fluent</em> (regardless of meaning preservation)?</li>!-->
                            <li><strong>Well-suited</strong><br>Which of the rewritten utterances is <em>most well suited </em> to the entire context?</li>
                            
                        </ul>            
                        Some notes:
                        <ul>
                            <li>What is <b><span class="task_toxicity">toxicity</span><span class="task_sentiment">sentiment</span><span class="task_formality">formality</span> strength</b>?<br> <span class="task_toxicity">Toxicity</span><span class="task_sentiment">Sentiment</span><span class="task_formality">Formality</span> strength determines how well the rewrites exhibit the desired target <span class="task_toxicity">toxicity</span><span class="task_sentiment">sentiment</span><span class="task_formality">formality</span>.  <br />  <br /> 
                              <span class="task_sentiment"> For example, a sentence exhibiting a <em> positive </em> sentiment about a restaurant would describe the food as being delicious and the dining environment as vibrant. On the flip side, a sentence with a <em>negative</em> sentiment about a restaurant might describe the food as unhygenic and the dining environment to be unpleasant. </span> 
                              <span class="task_formality"> For example, a sentence which sounds serious/less trivial, polite/less casual might be percieved as <i>formal</i> language</span>
                              <span class="task_toxicity"> For example, an utterance which is obscene, indecent, insulting, hurtful, disgusting, morally repugnant, or which breaches commonly accepted standards of decent and proper speech is considered as <i>toxic/offensive</i> language.</span>
                            </li>  
                            <li>What is <b>event-level meaning similarity</b>?<br>Two sentences are similar in event-level details if they describe <em>roughly the same event(s), entities, and their relations</em>, irrespective of <span class="task_toxicity">toxicity</span><span class="task_sentiment">sentiment</span><span class="task_formality">formality</span>-style attribute differences. But, it's okay if a few details in the sentence get changed a bit.
                              <br /> <br /> 
                            For example, when rewriting a news article, it is important to maintain the accuracy of the who, what, when, where, and why aspects of the story. 
                            </li>
                            <span class="task_toxicity"> <li>What is <b>intended meaning similarity</b>?<br>Two sentences are similar in their intended meaning if they capture <em>roughly the same overall message or purpose</em>.  Intended meaning goes beyond the specific details and focuses on <em>maintaining the author's intention, tone, and the implied meaning </em> in the rewritten text.  But again, it's okay if a few details in the sentence get changed a bit. 
                              <br /> <br /> 
                              For example, consider an original toxic sentence - "You're an idiot for thinking that way.". When this sentence is rewritten to make it less toxic and to maintain the intended meaning to express disagreement, it might sound like "I disagree with your perspective". 
                            </li>
                            </span>
                            
                             <span class="task_formality"> <li>What is <b>intended meaning similarity</b>?<br>Two sentences are similar in their intended meaning if they capture <em>roughly the same overall message or purpose</em>.  Intended meaning goes beyond the specific details and focuses on <em>maintaining the author's intention, tone, and the implied meaning </em> in the rewritten text.  But again, it's okay if a few details in the sentence get changed a bit. 
                              <br /> <br /> 
                              For example, consider an original informal utterance - "Hey, wanna grab some grub later?". When this utterance is rewritten in a more formal style, while maintaining its intended meaning of asking someone to join for a meal, it might be rewritten as "Hello, would you like to join me for a meal later?"
                            </li> </span>
                            
                            
                            <li>What is <b>well-suited</b>?<br> A rewrite can have the required <span class="task_toxicity">toxicity</span><span class="task_sentiment">sentiment</span><span class="task_formality">formality</span> and be similar in meaning to overall content of the original sentence, but it may not necessarily be <i>fitting / appropriate / relevant / well-suited</i> in the given context of the dialog or document. The rewrite should be meaningful and coherent while maintaining the flow of the conversation. </li>
                        </ul>
